<h1>context</h1>
<h2>In class presentation</h2>
<p>the takeaways that i learned from doing this in class presentation was that you have to prepare just like the expo if you dont prepare your presentation would be all over the place. Also try to take your time on this because when you dont your presentation would be a whole mess so at least aim for 5-10 mintues.</p>

<h2>Expo presentation</h2>

<p>The takeaways that i learned from doing the expo presentaton is that you have to be more outgoing. What i mean is that you have to talk to people more and also time. Dont try to spend all the time on your elevator cause all the judges have to be there for 1 minute max. So try to keep a good tab on your time cause you dont want to get lost in the sauce.</p>
