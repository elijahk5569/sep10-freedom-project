# Entry 1 deciding my topic(international affairs)
##### 10/23/23

The topic i decided was international affairs because i wanted to learn what technology they use for events and activities that involve the governments, politics, economies, etc. of different countries. When i was research i found many sites that talk about international affairs. For example ["Fabricating a war? Russian (dis)information on Ukraine "](https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/99/5/2015/7239803?searchresult=1) This article talks about false information or a fake war going on with the internet or technology. Also talking about making fake information. This one talks about ["Sweden, NATO and the role of diasporas in foreign policy"](https://academic.oup.com/ia/advance-article/doi/10.1093/ia/iiad239/7284498?searchresult=1) to sum it up it talks about how, and when, diasporic actors can influence the foreign policy of liberal democratic states. They can use multiple technology like emails,drones,etc to get across a message. But international affairs is not just for fighting or getting a message across the country. It also includes get togethers with different countries or something with governments, politics, economies, etc. When i learn what it envole i was interasted in the topic and what technology it uses. When i wa little i knew a little but not a lot, so i think this is a perfect time to learn about international affairs.
